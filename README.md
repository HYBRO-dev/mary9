# Mary9
A python toolbox for hybrid global-local optimization

## About
Mary9 is a toolbox for optimization of real valued, potentially 
high-dimensional, non-convex, and multi-modal objective functions.
It aims at combining the strengths of two different optimization concepts:
the exploration capacities of gradient-free, global optimization algorithms and
the (typically superior) exploitation possibilities of gradient-based, 
(multi-start) local optimization approaches. Mary9 is supposed to work similar 
to the MATLAB-based hybrid global-local optimization toolbox MEIGO, but 
implements some additional ideas, such as the concept of hyper-heuristics,
or the more recent local optimization toolbox Fides.


## Functioning
Here will be something about how the algorithms works


## Documentation
There will be some documentation on readthedocs in the near future.
